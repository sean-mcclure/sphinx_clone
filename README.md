# Sphinx Clone

  

Sphinx Clone is for creating Sphinx-type documentation without the extensive overhead of the original Sphinx library (and with some aesthetic improvements). Sphinx clone mimics the [read_the_docs theme](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 

Sphinx Clone is responsive, conforming to different screen sizes and devices.

Sphinx clone can be used with any language as all function details are listed in a simple JSON file.
